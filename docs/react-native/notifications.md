# Push Notifications

Push notifications in React Native involve communication between an app, a
backend server, and a push notification service (e.g., Apple Push Notification
Service (APNs) for iOS or Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) for Android).

## Flow Overview

1. User Opt-In:

   - The app asks for the user’s permission to send push notifications.
   - On iOS, this is required by the operating system.
   - On Android, permissions are usually granted during app installation.

2. Device Registration:

- The app registers itself with a push notification service (APNs for iOS, FCM
  for Android).
- The service returns a Device Token (iOS) or a Registration Token (Android),
  which uniquely identifies the app instance on the device.

3. Server Configuration:

- The backend server securely stores the device tokens and is configured to
  communicate with the respective push notification services.

4. Push Notification Sending:

- The backend server sends a notification request (with a payload and token) to
  APNs/FCM.
- The service routes the notification to the target device using the token.

5. Notification Received:

- The app receives the notification via an event listener or displays it in the
  notification center.

## APNs Certificate

A certificate generated by Apple and uploaded to your backend server.

### How to Generate

1. Log in to the Apple Developer Console.
2. Create an App ID and enable the “Push Notifications” service.
3. Generate a Certificate Signing Request (CSR) from your local machine.
4. Upload the CSR to Apple to generate the APNs certificate.
5. Download the certificate, convert it to .p12 or .pem format, and upload it to
   your backend server or push notification provider (e.g., Firebase).
