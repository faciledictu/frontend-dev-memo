# What is React Native

React Native is an open-source framework developed by Facebook that allows
developers to build mobile applications using JavaScript and React. Unlike
traditional web applications, React Native enables the creation of fully
functioning mobile apps for iOS and Android with a single codebase.

## Key Differences from React

**React** is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces on the web. It
uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to render web components in the browser.

**_React Native_** is a framework for building mobile applications for iOS and
Android. It uses native components instead of web components, rendering UI
elements that compile into native code.

- **Rendering:** React renders HTML/CSS in the browser; React Native renders native
  mobile UI components.

- **Styling:** React uses CSS; React Native uses a StyleSheet object.

- **Ecosystem:** React has web-specific tools; React Native has mobile-focused
  tools.

In essence, React is for building web UIs, while React Native is for mobile UIs.
