# Server Components

One of the key features of App Router system is the ability to use Server
Components.

Server Components allow you to offload the rendering of components to the
server, improving performance by reducing the amount of JavaScript that needs to
be sent to the client.

All components are treated as React Server Components by default.

In the following example, the `UsersPage` component fetches data on the server
and renders a list of users. This approach ensures that the user data is
available immediately when the page loads, improving both performance and SEO.

```javascript title="app/users/page.js"
import { fetchUsers } from '../lib/api';

export default async function UsersPage() {
  const users = await fetchUsers();

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Users</h1>
      <ul>
        {users.map((user) => (
          <li key={user.id}>{user.name}</li>
        ))}
      </ul>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## When to Use

- **When your component relies on data that can be fetched on the server**, such
  as from a database or an external API, using a Server Component can reduce
  client-side JavaScript and improve performance.

- **For pages that require better SEO**, server-side rendering ensures that the
  content is fully rendered when the page is served to the client, making it
  more accessible to search engines.

- **For reducing the initial load time** of your page since the server can send
  fully rendered HTML to the client.

- **When results can be cached** and used again on future requests and across
  users.

- **When you need to handle sensitive data** or perform operations that should
  not be exposed to the client.

## Rendering Strategies

There are three different server rendering strategies:

- Static Rendering
- Dynamic Rendering on Server
- Streaming

### Static Rendering

With static rendering, routes are pre-rendered **at build time** and the results
are cached.

This approach is suitable for content that doesn't change frequently, like blog
posts or product pages. The pre-rendered HTML is served quickly, enhancing
performance and reducing server load.

### Dynamic Rendering

Dynamic rendering occurs **at request time**, providing personalized content or
data that changes frequently.

If **a dynamic function** or **uncached data request** is found during
rendering, Next.js will render the whole route dynamically.

:::note

Dynamic functions use information known at request time, such as cookies and
headers (`cookies()` and `headers()` functions), or search parameters
(`searchParams` prop).

#### Instant Loading State

:::info How Does Serves-Side Rendering Work

With SSR, there's a series of steps that need to be completed before a user can
see and interact with a page:

1. All data for a given page is fetched on the server.
2. The server then renders the HTML for the page.
3. The HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the page are sent to the client.
4. A non-interactive user interface is shown using the generated HTML, and CSS.
5. Finally, React hydrates the user interface to make it interactive.

:::

Instant Loading State allows us to show the user a non-interactive version of
the route as soon as possible, and replace it with an interactive version as
soon as the actual data is prepared.

To implement this you need to create a file `loading.js` in the route folder.

```javascript
export default function Loading() {
  // You can add any UI inside Loading, including a Skeleton.
  return <LoadingSkeleton />;
}
```

The file `loading.js` will be nested inside `layout.js`. It will automatically
wrap the `page.js` file and any children below in a `<Suspense>` boundary. It
can be represented this way:

```palintext title="Component Hierarchy"
  <Layout>                            <- export from layout.js
    <Header />
    <SideNav />
    <Suspense fallback={<Loading />}> <- export from loading.js
      <Page />                        <- export from page.js
    </Suspense>
  </Layout>
```

However, the user won't be able to see the actual content of the page until all
the fetches in the `page.js` have been performed on the server.

### Streaming

Streaming allows you to progressive output the page by components. The whole
work is splitted into chunks and streamed to the client as it is ready.

Streaming is built into the Next.js App Router by default.

Using Suspense boundaries, developers can show fallback UI and swap in the
actual content once it loads, enhancing user experience and interaction speed.

By streaming, we allow to send parts of the actual to the client progressively
as they are rendered on the server.

<Tabs>

<TabItem value="app/page.js" label="app/page.js" default>

```jsx
import { Suspense } from 'react';
import Posts from 'components/Posts';
import Users from 'components/Users';
import Placeholder from 'components/Placeholder';

export default function Page() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>My Blog</h1>
      <Suspense fallback={<Placeholder />}>
        <Posts />
      </Suspense>
      <Suspense fallback={<Placeholder />}>
        <Users />
      </Suspense>
    </div>
  );
}
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="components/Posts.js" label="components/Posts.js">

```jsx
async function fetchPosts() {
  const res = await fetch('https://api.example.com/posts');
  return res.json();
}

export default async function Posts() {
  const posts = await fetchPosts();

  return (
    <ul>
      {posts.map((post) => (
        <li key={post.id}>{post.title}</li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  );
}
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="components/Users.js" label="components/Users.js">

```jsx
async function fetchUsers() {
  const res = await fetch('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users');
  return res.json();
}

export default async function Users() {
  const users = await fetchUsers();

  return (
    <ul>
      {users.map((user) => (
        <li key={user.id}>{user.name}</li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  );
}
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="components/Placeholder.js" label="components/Placeholder.js">

```jsx
export default function Placeholder() {
  return <p>Loading...</p>;
}
```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

This approach reduces Time to First Byte (TTFB), First Contentful Paint (FCP)
and Time to Interactive(TTI) and allows users to see and interact with parts of
the page sooner, even before other data is fetched and rendered.
