# Route Handlers

In Next.js, Route Handlers are used to define custom logic for handling HTTP
requests in the App Router. They provide a way to handle various HTTP methods
like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc., within the application. Route Handlers are
particularly useful for implementing server-side functionality directly within
the application without the need for an external API server.

Here's a basic overview of Route Handlers in Next.js:

File Structure: Route Handlers are defined within the /`app` directory and hawe `route.js` or ``route.js` name.

HTTP Methods: You can define specific handlers for different HTTP methods. For
example:

```jsx
// app/api/hello/route.js
export async function GET(request) {
  return new Response('Hello, GET request!');
}

export async function POST(request) {
  const data = await request.json();
  return new Response(`Hello, ${data.name}`);
}
```
