Node.js is an open-source runtime environment that allows you to run JavaScript
code on the server side, outside of a web browser.

It uses Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine to execute code efficiently

Node.js is known for its event-driven, non-blocking I/O model, which makes it
ideal for building scalable and high-performance applications, like web servers
and real-time chat apps.

It comes with a vast library of modules that simplify coding tasks, and it's
popular for both front-end and back-end development because it can handle many
connections at the same time without slowing down.
