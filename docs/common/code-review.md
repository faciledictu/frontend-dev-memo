# Code Reviewing

Code reviewing is the process of examining another developer's code to ensure it
meets quality standards before merging it into the main codebase.

## How it works

1. Submission: A developer submits their code for review.
2. Review and Feedback: Reviewers check the code and provide comments and
   suggestions.
3. Revisions: The original developer revises the code based on feedback.
4. Approval and Merge: Reviewers approve the revised code and it is merged into
   the main codebase.

## Purpose

- Quality Assurance: Ensures high-quality code.
- Bugs Detection: Finds bugs early and identifies security issues.
- Knowledge Sharing: Promotes learning among team members.
- Consistency: Maintains uniform coding standards.
- Collaboration: Enhances teamwork and problem-solving.
