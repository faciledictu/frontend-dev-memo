# CI/CD Overview

CI/CD stands for Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (or Continuous
Delivery). It's a set of practices and tools designed to improve the speed,
quality, and reliability of software development and delivery. Here's a brief
overview of each component:

## Continuous Integration (CI)

Developers regularly merge their code changes into a shared repository, usually
multiple times a day. Each merge triggers an automated build and testing
process, ensuring that new code changes do not break the existing codebase.

## Continuous Deployment (CD)

Once the code passes all automated tests, it's automatically deployed to a
staging or production environment. This ensures that the latest version of the
application is always ready for release. Continuous Delivery is a slightly
different concept where the deployment to production is manual but can be done
at any time.

## CI/CD for Frontend Applications

For a React application, a CI/CD pipeline can be set up in GitLab to automate
tasks such as linting, testing, building, and deploying the application.

### Key Stages of a Frontend CI/CD Pipeline

1. **Linting.** Ensure code quality and consistency.

2. **Testing.** Run unit tests to verify the functionality of the code.

3. **Building.** Create a production-ready build of the application.

4. **Deploying.** Deploy the build to a staging or production environment.

### Example

Hereâ€™s a sample `.gitlab-ci.yml` file to illustrate a basic CI/CD pipeline for a
frontend application.

```yaml
stages:
  - lint
  - test
  - build
  - deploy

# Linting Stage
lint:
  stage: lint
  image: node:14
  script:
    - npm install
    - npm run lint
  only:
    - merge_requests
    - main

# Testing Stage
test:
  stage: test
  image: node:14
  script:
    - npm install
    - npm run test
  only:
    - merge_requests
    - main

# Building Stage
build:
  stage: build
  image: node:14
  script:
    - npm install
    - npm run build
  artifacts:
    paths:
      - build/
  only:
    - main

# Deploying Stage
deploy:
  stage: deploy
  image: node:14
  script:
    - npm install -g firebase-tools
    - firebase deploy --token "$FIREBASE_DEPLOY_TOKEN"
  only:
    - main
```
