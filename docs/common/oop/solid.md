# SOLID principles

SOLID are a set of five design principles that aim to make software designs more
understandable, flexible, and maintainable. They were introduced by Robert C.
Martin (also known as Uncle Bob) to provide guidelines for writing better
object-oriented code.

## Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)

This principle states that a class should have only one reason to change,
meaning it should have only one job or responsibility. In other words, a class
should focus on doing one thing well, rather than trying to do too much.

## Open/Closed Principle (OCP)

The Open/Closed Principle suggests that software entities (such as classes,
modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension but closed for
modification. This means that you should be able to extend the behavior of a
module without modifying its source code.

## Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)

The Liskov Substitution Principle states that objects of a superclass should be
replaceable with objects of its subclasses without affecting the correctness of
the program. In simpler terms, any object should be able to be substituted with
an object of its subtype without altering the behavior of the program.

## Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)

The Interface Segregation Principle suggests that clients should not be forced
to depend on interfaces they do not use. It advocates for the creation of
smaller, specific interfaces rather than large, monolithic ones, to prevent
clients from being forced to implement methods they don't need.

## Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

The Dependency Inversion Principle encourages the use of abstractions (such as
interfaces or abstract classes) to decouple high-level modules from low-level
modules. It states that high-level modules should not depend on low-level
modules directly, but both should depend on abstractions.

Adhering to these principles can lead to more modular, maintainable, and
scalable software designs, making it easier to understand, extend, and modify
code over time.
