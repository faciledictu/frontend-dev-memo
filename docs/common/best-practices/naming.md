# Naming

## Common Principles

- Choose names that clearly describe the purpose. Names should be as short as
  possible but long enough to convey meaning.

- Use full words instead of abbreviations.

- Avoid reserved words as names.

- Stick to a consistent naming convention throughout your codebase. For JS they
  are _camelCase_ and _PascalCase_.

## Variables

- Use nouns for variables.

- Use Plurals for arrays and collections.

- Except for loop indices, avoid using single character names.

- Use named constants instead of hard-coding values directly in your code.

## Functions

- Use verbs for functions (because functions are actions).

- If the function is predicate the name is often starting with _is_, _has_,
  _can_, or _should_.

- Function names should clearly indicate if they have side effects.
